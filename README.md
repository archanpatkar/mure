Mure is rule engine, more specifically a string term rewriting system or more generally a production rule system, but the name **`mu`** **`r`**`ule` **`e`**`ngine` has been chosen due to the abbreviation it leads to, the word **mure** and its meaning is very much what Dr. Hofstadter is trying to illustrate using the MU puzzle in the book the distinction of **`reasoning in the system`** and **`reasoning about the system`** and the limitation of expressing some propositions or proofs from within the system (trapped/imprisioned/constrained from the foundational formalisms or axioms of the system) but as humans we have meta-reasoning skills which is activated as soon we start to get a hint from getting stuck from reasoning inside the system and we start to think and analyze the system as a whole and in that effort we figure out the limitation of the system.
